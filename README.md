# Sandbox

Collaborative flavoured ACE editor with sandbox features.

I made this to teach programming to my friends, which turned out to be hard without a reliable collaborative editor. It's only few hundred lines in length because it's buildt together of modules written by other people.

If someone contributes I'll provide GPLv3 license -- but until that it's just a snippet so it comes with I don't really care about a license -license -- but If you try to convert it into yet another SaaS I'll come to your home through a window and bite your sad worthless ass apart from your body.
